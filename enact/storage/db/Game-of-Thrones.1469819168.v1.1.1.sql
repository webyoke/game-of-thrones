On the way back, his children adopt six dire wolf pups, the animal of his <a title=\"Sigil (disambiguation)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28disambiguation%29\">sigil</a>. There are three male wolf pups and two female wolf pups, as well as an albino runt, which aligns with his three true born sons, two true born daughters, and one bastard son. That night, Ned receives word of the death of his mentor, Lord <a title=\"Jon Arryn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a>, the principal advisor to Ned\'s childhood friend, King <a title=\"Robert Baratheon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baratheon\">Robert Baratheon</a>. During his own visit to Ned\'s castle of <a title=\"Winterfell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterfell\">Winterfell</a>, Robert recruits Ned to replace Arryn as the King\'s Hand. Ned is reluctant, but agrees to go when he learns that Arryn\'s widow <a title=\"Lysa Tully\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysa_Tully\">Lysa</a> believes Queen <a title=\"Cersei Lannister\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\">Cersei</a> and <a title=\"House Lannister\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Lannister\">her family</a> poisoned Arryn. Shortly thereafter, Ned\'s son <a title=\"Bran Stark\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_Stark\">Bran</a> inadvertently discovers Cersei <a title=\"Incest\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest\">in coitus</a> with her twin brother <a title=\"Jaime Lannister\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Lannister\">Jaime Lannister</a>, who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair.

Arya\'s dire wolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey to protect her, and Arya chases Nymeria away to protect her from the Lannisters\' wrath, wherefore Sansa\'s dire wolf Lady is executed in Nymeria\'s place. At Winterfell, an <a title=\"Assassin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin\">assassin</a> attempts to kill Bran, and Catelyn departs for King\'s Landing to bring word of this to Ned. Shortly after that, Bran awakens as a <a title=\"Paraplegic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegic\">paraplegic</a>, with no memory of the cause of his fall. At King\'s Landing, Ned meets the King\'s advisors, including <a title=\"Petyr Baelish\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petyr_Baelish\">Petyr Baelish</a>, known as Littlefinger, the royal treasurer, and <a title=\"Varys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varys\">Varys</a>, the master of secrets. Ned soon assumes effective royal power, while Robert devotes his time to debauchery. Upon Catelyn\'s arrival in King\'s Landing, she is brought to Baelish, who identifies <a title=\"Tyrion Lannister\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a>, the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, as the owner of the dagger used against Bran, and agrees to help Ned investigate the possibility of Lannister treason.

In retaliation for Tyrion\'s abduction, his father Lord <a title=\"Tywin Lannister\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tywin_Lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a> sends soldiers on raids across Catelyn\'s family lands.</p><p>Ned eventually discovers that Robert\'s legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei\'s children by Jaime and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery because of that. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert\'s death in a hunting accident. Ned, made lord-regent by Robert\'s will, enlists Littlefinger\'s help to secure the loyalty and assistance of the city guards to challenge Joffrey\'s claim on the throne; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned\'s arrest, the death of his men, and Sansa\'s imprisonment by the Lannisters. Arya escapes, and Joffrey is crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms. Ned eventually agrees to join the <a title=\"Night\'s Watch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night%27s_Watch\">Night\'s Watch</a> in exchange for Sansa\'s safety, but Joffrey orders him beheaded.</p><p>Robb Stark has gathered an army and marched south in response to his father\'s arrest; and upon learning of Ned\'s death, attempts to raise further support from and to aid his maternal grandfather, Lord <a title=\"Hoster Tully\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoster_Tully\">Hoster Tully</a>.

The Wall is manned by the <a title=\"Night\'s Watch\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night%27s_Watch\">Night\'s Watch</a>: an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, forgoing marriage, titles, property, and children.

Jon hopes that his combat skills will earn him assignment to the Rangers, the military arm of the Night\'s Watch, but instead is made a steward (and thus potential successor) to the leader of the Watch, Lord Commander <a title=\"Jeor Mormont\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeor_Mormont\">Jeor Mormont</a>. Benjen, who had led a small party of Rangers beyond the Wall, fails to return, and six months later, the dead bodies of two of the Rangers from his party are recovered beyond the Wall, but soon re-animate as <a title=\"Wight\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wight\">wights</a>, which kill six men and threaten Mormont, who is saved by Jon.</p><p>When word of his father\'s execution reaches Jon, he attempts to join Robb against the Lannisters but is prevented by his comrades and persuaded by Mormont to remain loyal to the Watch.

After that, an assassin seeking King Robert\'s favor attempts to poison Daenerys and her unborn child, and Drogo agrees to help her conquer Westeros. While sacking villages to fund the invasion, Drogo is wounded, and Daenerys commands a captive <a title=\"Cunning folk\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunning_folk\">folk healer</a> to save him. When he is beyond saving, the healer, angered by the Dothraki raids, sacrifices Daenerys\' unborn child to power the spell to save Drogo\'s life, which restores Drogo\'s health but leaves him in a vegetative state. Most of the Dothraki army departs to follow a new leader. Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow and orders the healer tied to Drogo\'s funeral pyre. She places her three dragon eggs on the pyre, enters it herself, and emerges unscathed with three newly hatched dragons suckling at her breasts.

More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile the <a title=\"House Greyjoy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Greyjoy\">Greyjoys</a> now hold Robb\'s home territory of <a title=\"Winterfell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterfell\">Winterfell</a> and the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord <a title=\"Hoster Tully\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoster_Tully\">Hoster Tully</a> dies, Catelyn\'s brother <a title=\"Edmure Tully\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmure_Tully\">Edmure</a> becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon\'s brothers, as well as his daughter <a title=\"Asha Greyjoy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Greyjoy\">Asha</a>, vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Walder Frey\'s daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb\'s marriage.</p><p>Arya Stark and her friends encounter the \'Brotherhood Without Banners\', led by Lord <a title=\"Beric Dondarrion\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion\">Beric Dondarrion</a> and the priest <a title=\"Thoros of Myr\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoros_of_Myr\">Thoros of Myr</a>: originally sent by Eddard Stark to put down the Lannister raids, and now defending the <a title=\"Peasant\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant\">smallfolk</a> of the Riverlands. The group encounters <a title=\"Sandor Clegane\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandor_Clegane\">Sandor Clegane</a>, known as the Hound, and offers him <a title=\"Trial by combat\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat\">trial by battle</a>, which he wins by killing Lord Beric; but Thoros resurrects Beric thereafter. Arya is kidnapped by the Hound for ransom, and they proceed to Riverrun. On their journey, they discover that Robb and Catelyn will be at Edmure\'s wedding at the Frey bridge-stronghold <a title=\"The Twins (A Song of Ice and Fire)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twins_%28A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire%29\">The Twins</a>, and change their destination accordingly.</p><p>Robb Stark\'s army reaches the Twins, where Frey agrees to forgive Robb if the wedding between Edmure and Roslin takes place. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys kill Robb\'s army. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, and Catelyn mutilates her own face in grief. One of the Freys cuts her throat, and her body is discarded, naked, into the adjacent river. Robb\'s corpse is beheaded, and the head of his <a title=\"Dire wolf\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolf\">dire wolf</a> sewn in its place, with his crown nailed to the direwolf\'s head. Many of the northern lords are killed, and the survivors captured. Edmure, after consummating his marriage, is kept as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding.</p><p>It is thereafter revealed that Roose Bolton engineered the defeat at Duskendale by sending Robb\'s soldiers into a trap set by the Lannisters, while holding his own forces in reserve, and arranging that all but his own forces would be slaughtered in rearguard. The combined effect was to kill off the forces of other Northern Houses loyal to Robb while leaving the Bolton army unscathed. Tywin Lannister (the King\'s Hand and grandfather) rewards Roose by naming House Bolton \'Lord Paramount of the North\', in place of <a title=\"House Stark\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Stark\">House Stark</a>. The crown also legitimizes Roose\'s bastard son <a title=\"Ramsay Snow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Snow\">Ramsay Snow</a>, under the name of \'Ramsay Bolton\', as the new Lord of Winterfell.</p><p>Arya and the Hound arrive at the outskirts of the castle as the Red Wedding is taking place; to keep her from running inside to her death, the Hound knocks Arya unconscious and takes her downriver. As she sleeps, Arya sees through the eyes of her long-missing direwolf, Nymeria, that her mother Catelyn is dead. Arya and the Hound encounter Gregor Clegane\'s men, by whom the Hound is wounded. His wound becomes infected, and Arya abandons him. She finds a ship from the Free City of <a title=\"Braavos\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braavos\">Braavos</a>, but the captain refuses her passage until she offers him the coin and password \"Valar Morghulis\", given to her by <a title=\"Jaqen H\'ghar\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaqen_H%27ghar\">Jaqen H\'ghar</a>. The captain replies \"Valar Dohaeris\", and they set sail for Braavos.</p><p>In the <a title=\"Epilogue\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilogue\">Epilogue</a> of the book, a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners and oversees the lynching of two Freys present at the Red Wedding.</p><h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_South_.2F_King.27s_Landing\">The South / King\'s Landing</span></h4><p>After the Battle of the Blackwater, <a title=\"Davos Seaworth\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos_Seaworth\">Davos Seaworth</a> is taken to Dragonstone by men loyal to King Stannis. Davos blames the priestess <a title=\"Melisandre\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisandre\">Melisandre</a> for Stannis\'s defeat, and is imprisoned for treason (Melisandre having foreseen his intention to assassinate her). At Melisandre\'s behest, Stannis releases Davos and asks him to serve as his Hand. With Stannis\' cooperation, Melisandre has performed rituals to awaken \"stone dragons\", which she identifies as the great statues adjacent to the castle. (Chronologically, this happens shortly before the Red Wedding.)</p><p>King\'s Landing welcomes the <a title=\"House Tyrell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Tyrell\">Tyrells</a> as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of <a title=\"Margaery Tyrell\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell\">Margaery Tyrell</a>. Sansa is soon compelled to marry <a title=\"Tyrion Lannister\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a>, who refuses to consummate the marriage against her will. Balon Greyjoy offers an alliance on the conditions that he rules the <a title=\"Iron Islands\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Islands\">Iron Islands</a> and the North as a separate kingdom, but Tywin refuses.</p><p>Word reaches King\'s Landing of the sudden death of Greyjoy, followed by news of the Red Wedding. Joffrey gloats that he has \"won\" the war; whereas the governing \'Small Council\' is shocked to learn that Tywin secretly masterminded the Red Wedding. Tyrion warns his father that the defeated Northerners will not quietly submit to Bolton rule, but Tywin dismisses his warning. Later, Tyrion reveals that Joffrey sent the assassin who attempted to kill <a title=\"Bran Stark\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_Stark\">Bran Stark</a> at Winterfell, and thus <a title=\"A Game of Thrones\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones\">set the war in motion</a>.</p><p>Margaery and Joffrey\'s wedding is held as planned; but during the ensuing festivities, King Joffrey is poisoned, and Tyrion framed for the murder, whereupon his sister <a title=\"Cersei Lannister\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cersei_Lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a> places Tyrion on trial. Sansa is smuggled out of the castle by the jester Dontos, and taken to Lord <a title=\"Petyr Baelish\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petyr_Baelish\">Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish</a>, who has Dontos killed and admits culpability in Joffrey\'s death and Tyrion\'s framing, incriminating several of the Tyrell family as well. Littlefinger, with Sansa, departs King\'s Landing for <a title=\"The Eyrie\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eyrie\">the Eyrie</a>, scheming to marry <a title=\"Lysa Arryn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysa_Arryn\">Lysa Arryn</a>, Catelyn\'s sister, with the blessing of the Small Council, to gain the support of House Arryn.</p><p>Davos discovers a request by the Night\'s Watch for aid against <a title=\"Mance Rayder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mance_Rayder\">Mance Rayder</a> and the \"<a title=\"Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Others_%28A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire%29\">Others</a>\". Melisandre convinces Stannis to sacrifice <a title=\"Edric Storm\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edric_Storm\">Edric Storm</a>, a bastard son of Stannis\'s late brother King <a title=\"Robert Baratheon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baratheon\">Robert Baratheon</a>, to wake the dragons, but Davos smuggles Edric to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but is prevented when Davos shows Stannis the Night\'s Watch\'s plea.</p><p>Jaime and Brienne reach King\'s Landing to find that Joffrey\'s younger brother, <a title=\"Tommen Baratheon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommen_Baratheon\">Tommen Baratheon</a>, will inherit the throne; Tyrion is on trial for Joffrey\'s murder; and the Tyrell bannermen blame Brienne for <a title=\"Renly Baratheon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renly_Baratheon\">Renly Baratheon</a>\'s death. Jaime\'s severed right hand becomes infected, but he is healed by former maester Qyburn, earning Qyburn the admiration of Cersei. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey; rejects Cersei\'s advances; and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but refuses his father\'s offer of <a title=\"Casterly Rock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casterly_Rock\">Casterly Rock</a>, whereupon Tywin disinherits him. Against Tyrion, Cersei recruits the spymaster <a title=\"Varys\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varys\">Varys</a> and Tyrion\'s lover, <a title=\"Shae (A Song of Ice and Fire)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shae_%28A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire%29\">Shae</a>. Tyrion is approached by Prince <a title=\"Oberyn Martell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberyn_Martell\">Oberyn Martell</a> of <a title=\"Dorne\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorne\">Dorne</a>, who offers a trial by combat against Cersei\'s champion, Gregor Clegane, and nearly emerges victorious, but dies in the duel. Tyrion is again condemned to death but is freed by Jaime and Varys. Jaime reveals that Tyrion\'s first wife Tysha was a crofter\'s daughter, not a prostitute as Tywin told him; wherefore Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin and tells Jaime that Cersei took other lovers while he was Robb Stark\'s captive. During Tyrion\'s escape, he strangles Shae and kills Tywin in his privy. Jaime frees Brienne and gives her a sword reforged from \'Ice\', Ned Stark\'s sword. He tells her to keep her oath to Catelyn, to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. He also tells her that he had killed the former King <a title=\"Aerys II Targaryen\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen\">Aerys II Targaryen</a> because he planned to burn the city and its inhabitants to spite Robert Baratheon. He then leaves king\'s landing, angry at Cersei for her relations with other men.</p><p>At the Eyrie, Littlefinger and Lysa are married, and Sansa remains hidden by pretending to be an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger\'s, named Alayne Stone. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison <a title=\"Jon Arryn\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Arryn\">Jon Arryn</a>, her late husband, to prevent her son from being fostered, and to write to Catelyn that Arryn had been poisoned by the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.

Jon and his captive <a title=\"Ygritte\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ygritte\">Ygritte</a> also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to shatter the Wall. After climbing the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, Ygritte murders the man, calling Jon a coward. Jon, with the assistance of Bran\'s direwolf (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black, ahead of the wildling force. The approaching army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, and Ygritte is slain.

It is implied that when the ruse is complete, the Manderlys discreetly murder the three Freys staying with them in revenge for Wyman\'s son, Wendel, killed at the Red Wedding. Lord Wyman explains to Davos that the Manderlys and other Northern vassals intend to feign submission to the Boltons, Freys, and Lannisters while plotting revenge. Wyman informs Davos that Osha the wildling took Rickon Stark to the remote island of Skagos and that they are in need of a skilled smuggler to retrieve Rickon and unite the Starks\' supporters around him; in return for this, Manderly and his vassals will side with Stannis.</p><p>Theon Greyjoy is revealed to be a prisoner in the Dreadfort\'s dungeon, mutilated and driven insane by torture, and Ramsay Bolton forces him to take on the identity of his servant \"Reek\". Ramsay\'s father Roose Bolton leads his army to Moat Cailin, along with several thousand Frey allies; Ramsay secures their passage by sending Reek, again assuming the identity of Theon Greyjoy, to negotiate the surrender of the Ironborn garrison abandoned by Victarion. Reek succeeds, but Ramsay flays the Ironborn regardless. When Roose arrives with Ramsay\'s bride \'Arya Stark\', Reek recognizes her as Sansa\'s friend Jeyne Poole. The wedding is held at Winterfell, and to convince the North that Jeyne is Arya, Reek assumes the role of Theon again to represent the lord of Winterfell and give away the bride. After the wedding, Ramsay repeatedly abuses Jeyne physically and sexually.</p><p>A series of murders in the castle increase the already high tensions between House Frey and the northern Houses present, with Roose and his vassals desperately trying to keep the peace. In Winterfell\'s godswood, Reek begs for forgiveness and hears Bran Stark\'s voice calling him \"Theon,\" which restores his sanity.

Although Aerys was very unpopular, his death at Jaime\'s hands was seen as the sign of a man without honour, damning his reputation and earning him the epithet \"The Kingslayer\". This nickname would come to define a dangerous, unpredictable man few trusted. However, Robert Baratheon, after becoming king, pardoned him on the rationale that someone had to kill Aerys. Regardless, his reputation coupled with his cynical, arrogant manner makes him appear evil at the beginning of the series. Jaime is also witty and capable; although he shies away from power, he has the cunning to play the game of thrones. Often he will make funny remarks to lighten the mood, supremely confident in his legendary martial abilities and charm.</p><p>In reality, Jaime is far more complex. He grew up admiring the Kingsguard knights of his early youth, all noted warriors and true knights, honourable and brave. He aspired to be like them and was honoured to be inducted into the Kingsguard. However, he became less pleased when he realised his appointment was to spite his powerful father, Lord Tywin Lannister, and to deprive him of his heir (Kingsguard resign all claim to land); further disillusionment came with having to listen to the king violently rape his wife but being forbidden to act by his brothers-in-arms, as his vow was not to question Aerys. Nonetheless, he held to his post, despite steadily seeing and doing nothing as per his oath, as his king descended further into madness. When Tywin Lannister\'s forces sacked King\'s Landing, Aerys ordered his pyromancers to destroy the city with the volatile substance wildfire. Hearing of the plot, Jaime decided to act. Knowing it was against his oath to the king, but equally that to not act would be against his oath as a knight to protect the weak, he chose the latter. Jaime was forced to kill Aerys before the order could be given and tracked down the pyromancers who had attempted to instigate the plot, saving the population of the capital. When Eddard Stark found him in the throne room, Jaime didn\'t tell him the reason why he had killed Aerys, partly due to the fact Eddard judged him before hearing a word, and partly because he kept his oath to hold the King\'s secrets, the only oath that didn\'t contradict his virtuous knightly ones. The shame of being called Kingslayer and the bitterness turned Jaime from the idealistic - if cocky - young man he had been into a more callous version of himself, arrogant and disdainful of others. Nonetheless, although he committed violent acts, they were always in protection of his family and his killing of Aerys weighed on his mind.</p><p>After having his hand removed by the cruel mercenary Vargo Hoat while travelling with Brienne, he began to try and rebuild himself and strove to become the man he once was.

Catelyn is sent by Robb to attempt to ally with Renly Baratheon and his massive Reach-Stormlands host. Catelyn meets Renly at Bitterbridge and follows his host to the ancestral Baratheon seat of Storm\'s End, where she witnesses first the unsuccessful parley between Renly and his older brother and rival claimant Stannis and then Renly\'s subsequent murder later that night by a shadow creature. Afterwards, Catelyn flees with Brienne of Tarth, one of Renly\'s kingsguard, to Riverrun. Upon hearing of her younger sons\' supposed murder at the hands of Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn goes to confront the captive Jaime Lannister. Although the novel ends her storyline ambiguously, it is revealed at the beginning of the third novel that Catelyn set him free and asked Brienne to escort him to King\'s Landing in an attempt to exchange him for her daughters, who were still captives of Joffrey. This, however, causes problems for Robb, and costs him an ally, House Karstark, who had held grudges against the Lannisters.</p>',5,2,10),(151,18,9,0,'7',5,2,11),(152,18,9,0,'',5,3,9),(153,18,9,0,'<p>Catelyn\'s brother Edmure Tully places Catelyn under house arrest at Riverrun, but Robb pardons her after he announces his wedding to Jeyne Westerling, invalidating his marriage proposal to House Frey.

However, Walder Frey and his men take revenge on Robb for his slight on their house by slaughtering the northern host, an act of treachery that became known as the \"Red Wedding\". In an attempt to save her son\'s life, Catelyn takes Aegon Frey hostage and kills him when Roose Bolton kills Robb regardless, but she still has her throat slashed by Raymund Frey. Three days later, Catelyn is resurrected by Lord Beric Dondarrion, who sacrifices his life force to revive her. However, the period of time she spent deceased has caused Catelyn\'s body to decay; furthermore, upon her reanimation, she loses most of her previous personality, except for her hatred of House Frey. Catelyn then assumes command of Dondarrion\'s outlaw band, the Brotherhood Without Banners, and changes their aim to exterminating House Frey.</p>',5,3,10),(154,18,9,0,'7',5,3,11),(155,18,9,0,'',5,4,9),(156,18,9,0,'<p>Stoneheart and the Brotherhood come upon a small party led by Brienne.
